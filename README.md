The Mach entity component system, written from first-principles and designed for deep tooling capabilities.

## Features

* Initially a 100% clean-room implementation, working from first-principles; later informed by research into how other open-source ECS work.
* Enable deep tooling to provide tracing, editors, visualizers, profilers, etc.
* Fast, optimal for CPU caches, multi-threaded, leverage comptime for type safety.
* Dynamic, allow for very flexible runtime capabilities.
